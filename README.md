# 📖 NLP Classification - Logistic Regression Approach

This project applies **Logistic Regression** for **text classification** in a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) task**.  
Designed for a **Kaggle competition**, the model predicts sentiment and categorizes text using **machine learning techniques**.

## 🚀 Key Features  
🔹 **Text Preprocessing & Vectorization** (Tokenization, TF-IDF)  
🔹 **Logistic Regression Classifier** for NLP tasks  
🔹 **Data Standardization & Scaling** using StandardScaler  
🔹 **Model Saving & Loading** for efficient reuse  
🔹 **Kaggle-Compatible Submission File** for evaluation

## 🛠 Technologies & Frameworks  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning & Preprocessing)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Handling)  
- **Joblib** (Model Serialization)  
- **Kaggle** (Competition Dataset & Submission)
